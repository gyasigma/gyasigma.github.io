    <h2> Godspeed by Frank Ocean</h2>
    <p>Letting go appears as one of the final steps of healing. When you’re able to relinquish bitterness and wish someone well, that’s real growth. It’s not a requirement—no two paths of healing will ever look the same—but it is a novel moment for Frank Ocean as he approaches the conclusion of Blonde with the penultimate track, “Godspeed.” Frank Ocean begins “Godspeed” by allowing his grief to be a part of him: “I will always love you, how I do.” The acceptance of a persisting love, and not allowing it to morph into hatred, gives us the impression Frank Ocean has used all of Blonde to cope, and we’re finally on the other side of his broken heart. “Wishing you godspeed, glory / There will be mountains you won’t move / (Ooh, ooh, ooh) / Still I’ll always be there for you, how I do / I let go of my claim on you” —Frank Ocean, “Godspeed” </p>

        <h4> Don't by Bryson Tiller </h4>

            In the opening lines, Tiller warns the girl’s current dude, “Don’t play with her, don’t be dishonest.” He highlights that he’s “back and better,” ready to step up and be the man she needs.

            <h5>Piano Man by Billy Joel</h5>
            <p>Billy Joel’s “Piano Man” tells a story not just about Billy Joel’s time working in a bar, but gives the listener insight into the type of crowd seen at the bar as well. The song consists of themes like loneliness, growth, bitterness, sadness, and also a sense of happiness. One of the main messages is how everyone in the bar has their own story, and how life does not always seem to work out in line with everyone’s initial dreams. The beat of the song is, no surprise, led by a piano and has some harmonica blended within to add to this happy/sad melody. 

                Thee lyrics within “Piano Man” balance the piano in a perfect way, allowing Joel to tell the story of each and every one of the common bargoers. My favorite line from the song is the following: 
                
                “And the waitress is practicing politics
                
                As the businessmen slowly get stoned
                
                Yes, they’re sharing a drink they call loneliness
                
                But it’s better than drinkin’ alone”
                
                This to me, highlights Billy Joel’s combination of lyrical genius and expressive emotion as it shows the sad reality for many. However, the end of the song picks up into a positive tone as it shows the joy Billy Joel brings to these dreamers as he plays his piano for them night after night. He ignites a fire and allows these people to remember who they once were, letting everyone reminisce in a calm and comforting setting. One criticism of “Piano Man” would be that it may come across as somber and many people just simply do not like that type of style. Also, the beat is repetitive which some may find annoying after a few verses. In conclusion, “Piano Man” by Billy Joel is a smooth and catchy song with a deeper meaning of never giving up on your dreams.
